<!-- 
Starting v3.4, FusionCharts Suite XT enables theme for all your charts. However, in the previous versions, you could select a palette (numbered 1-5) for each, which is still supported. However, themes provide a more convenient and efficient way to manage the look & feel of your charts. 

Note: Theme is not applied to the chart in this fiddle, to highlight the functionality of palettes.

Attribute:
     # palette - Numbered 1 to 5.

Once you have selected a palette, you can individually over-ride specific properties of the chart using attributes specific to the element.
