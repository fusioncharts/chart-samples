<!-- Configuring gradient mix in a simple Horizontal Linear Gauge showing Server CPU Utilization using attributes:

    # gaugeFillMix - Set to "{light-10},{light-70},{dark-10}. 
      It takes a base color for fill and manipulates it to achieve light and dark color combinations. e.g. {light-10} represents a color which is 10% lighter than the color originally.
 
    # gaugeFillRatio - Set to "40,20,40".
      The ratio determines how far that particular color will spread before mixing with the next color.
