Roll over an anchor in the chart to see dynamic macros in action.

Macros allow you to use variables for positioning annotations on the charts. FusionCharts Suits XT allow 2 kinds of macros:
- Static macros: These macros help you locate position of static chart elements like canvas, chart borders etc. Examples are $canvasstartx, $canvasendx
- Dynamic macros: These macros help you locate position based on data points.  The format of dynamic macros is $dataset.0.set.2.x (in the syntax $dataset.dataset_index.set.set_index.x, with base as 0) or $dataset.0.set.2.y  (in the syntax $dataset.dataset_index.set.set_index.y, with base as 0)
