<!-- Usage of real-time update error event in Real time Cylinder showing the consumption of Diesel in Generator. 

Event : # realTimeUpdateComplete - RealtimeUpdateError event is raised when error occurs while updating data in a real-time gauge or chart. This event passes the HTTP Status (as number) of the error occurred. 

Note: Here in the fiddle we have used a dummy url in dataStreamURL attribute to 
 trigger the realtimeUpdateError event and get the status of the error.
