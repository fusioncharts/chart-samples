    # bgImage - URL of image
    # bgImageAlpha - Transparency of the image

Additional attributes that can be used to configure the background image (but not used in this example):

    # bgImageHalign - Horizontal alignment for image. Acceptable values are top, middle and bottom

Deviation from theme:
    # showAlternateHgridColor - Set to 1 so that divlines and area gel well with the image..
    # canvasBgAlpha - Set to 0 as the purpose of the chart to show background cosmetics.
