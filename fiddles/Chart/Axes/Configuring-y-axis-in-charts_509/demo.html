<!-- By default, if the chart is representing all positive values, the y-axis will be set to 0. However, if you want the y-axis lower limit to adapt to a value based on the data provided, setting adaptive y-Min value to 1 will do the trick. The chart will calculate the most appropriate lower limit, which is greater than 0, and apply.

Attribute:  
     # setAdaptiveYMin
