<!-- 
Values for data plots can be placed inside columns (both when rendered normally, or in rotated mode)  
    # placevaluesInside : Set to 1

Note: placevaluesInside has set to 1 explicitly in the theme 'fint'. Removing the attribute in this sample won't affect the sample. To see them horizontal, change the value of placevaluesInside to 0.
