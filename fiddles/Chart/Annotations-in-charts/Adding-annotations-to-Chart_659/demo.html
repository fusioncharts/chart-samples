<!-- This example creates an annotation on line chart to reflect the weekend in a different block of color, and a label on top of it.
Basic Structure for adding annotations to JSON:
annotations: {
    attribute: value // Applicable to all annotations groups and items 
    groups: [
        {
            items: [
                {
                    attribute: value // applicable to the speciific annotation
                }
            ]
        }        
    ]
}
