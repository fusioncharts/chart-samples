<!-- 
Custom vertical lines can be added to charts to indicate milestones or demarcation for data. In this example, we are adding a vertical line to a line chart showing visitors to website, to demarcate weekend: 

    # vline - 1/0
    # label - Label of line
    
 Deviation from theme:
    # showValues - Set to 0
