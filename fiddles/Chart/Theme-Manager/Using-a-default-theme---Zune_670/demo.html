<!-- This sample showcases how to use a default theme shipped with FusionCharts Suite XT.

Using themes lets you separate data from presentation, and customize all charts, gauges or maps in your application through a common file. This gives a coherent look and feel across multiple charts on a page. In addition, any change can be done in this theme centrally, and it will reflect across all charts.

Attributes:
    # theme - name of theme file to use. In this case, "zune".

Note:
    Theme can set to any of zune / carbon / ocean. Whenever "theme" attribute value is changed, the chart look and feel will change.
