<!--
    FusionCharts Suite XT ships with 3 default themes - zune, ocean and carbon. You can easily extend any of these themes and create a new one. Shown in this fiddle is an example of the same. The only difference is here we've created a theme inline in JavaSript code, which you can move to another JavaScript file, name as fusioncharts.themes.fire.js and then include in any page where you create a chart, gauge or map.

Pointers on how to extend a theme:
- Use the FusionCharts register method to register a theme with the name 'fire' (or your theme name).
- Maintain/add different hierarchies are defined in a theme file. (i.e base.chart attributes could be over written by specific chart level attribute.)
- Add conditional JavaScript logic if required. E.g., all colors can be dinimically generated at client side.
- Save it as a javascript file

Attribute:
    # theme: fire
Method
    FusionCharts.register();

<div id="chart-container">FusionCharts will render here</div>
