<!-- 
Starting v3.4, FusionCharts Suite XT allows you to theme your charts centrally using FusionCharts theme files (with configuration stored in JSON format). All the charts, gauges and maps can be configured through this central theme file. 

By default, FusionCharts Suite XT ships with 3 theme files - ocean, zune and carbon. This sample showcases the zune theme.

Attribute:
    # theme - sets the theme name, in this case, "zune".

Note:
    Theme can set to any of zune / carbon / ocean. Whenever "theme" attribute value is changed, the chart look and feel will change.
