<!-- 
    FusionCharts Suite XT allows you to specify a comma separated list of colors for use in different data series (or in case of single series charts, different data plots). The colors from this list are selected in a round-robin way for each data series present in your actual data.
    Attribute:
    # palettecolors - Comma separate list of colors for application to data series / data plots.
