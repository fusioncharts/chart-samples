    You can also create your own themes, in the FusionCharts Theme JSON format, and then apply to charts, gauges or maps. In this sample, we create a new custom theme inline and name it 'fire'.
    First, you need to use the FusionCharts.register() method to register a theme with the name 'fire'. Thereafter, you specify base attribute that apply to all the charts, and can then over-ride with chart specific attributes.
    To apply the theme, you just set theme='fire' in the chart's JSON/XML data. 
    This inline theme could also be stored as a separate .js file, and then included in all your web pages where you've a chart using FusionCharts. 

Attribute:
    theme: fire
Method
    FusionCharts.register();
