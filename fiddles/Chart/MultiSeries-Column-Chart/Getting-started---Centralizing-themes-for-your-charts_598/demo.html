<!-- Configuring charts with themes changes their cosmetic attributes. This gives a coherent look and feel across multiple charts on a page.

Attribute:
    # theme - sets the theme name, in this case, "zune".

Note:
    Theme can set to any of zune / carbon / ocean. Whenever "theme" attribute value is changed, the chart look and feel will change.
