<!--
FusionCharts Suite XT automatically compresses large numbers (thousands, millions and billions) to a more readable format by shortening them and then appending K,M,B respectively. This behavior is enabled by default. If you need to show full numbers, you can set :
# formatNumberScale - To 0 if you want to show full numbers. By default, it is set to 1, to enable compression of large numbers.
