<!-- Linked Chart: Data String method
    This sample showcases data in different levels (Quarterly Revenue and Monthly Revenue) through FusionCharts Linked Chart feature. First quarterly data is rendered and then by clicking on any particular quarter, monthly data for that particualr quarter is shown. 

This feature is highly useful to show complex data in different levels and provide options to zoom into the data through a single chart instance.-->
