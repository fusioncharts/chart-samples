<!-- Configuring display mode and alignment of background image using these attributes: 
                  # bgImageAlpha - Transparency
                  # bgImageDisplayMode - What mode to display in. 
                  # bgImageScale - What scale of image to use
                  # bgImageValign - Vertical alignment of image
                  # bgImageHalign - Horizontal alignment of image
Deviation from theme:
    # showAlternateHgridColor - Set to 1 so that divlines and area looks better.
    # canvasBgAlpha - Set to 0 as the purpose of the chart to show background cosmatics. Canvas takes a major space to catch the eyes.
    # valueFontColor - Set to #FFFFFF so that those looks prominent as
placed inside the plots.
