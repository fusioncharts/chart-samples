<!-- Manually over-riding y-axis lower and upper limits

Attributes: 
 
    # yAxisMaxValue - Value you want for y-axis max value (upper limit). If any data values exceeds this, the value you provided would be ignored, and the chart will re-calculate the upper limit.
    # yAxisMinValue- Value you want for y-axis min value (lower limit). If any data value is lower than this, the value you provided would be ignored, and the chart will re-calculate the lower limit.

In this example, the auto-calculated yAxisMaxValue would have been 2200000 and yAxisMinValue would have been 0, but we have set them explicitly to 2500000 and min value to 1000000.
